# Falcon
!!!WARNING!!!
The code and commits in this are a bodge, everything is a big mess to make it work one time for the demo/presentation we had to do but if i were to take this project further i would delete everything and start over with the knowledge aquired during the making of this.

This is a group project where we had to create an experience using the Novint Falcon in 3 weeks.

Uses FalconUnity library and server https://github.com/kbogert/falconunity
